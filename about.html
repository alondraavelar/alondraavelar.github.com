           <p>I was born and raised in a big city called Oakland in California and attend school at Lionel Wilson Prep. I have been attending Lionel Wilson Prep since middle school and is currently a rising sophomore. Something that I am looking forward for this year is to meet new people and to discover my passion. Although I am not completely sure with what I want to pursue in the future, three things that I have always enjoyed doing are doing art (drawing/painting), learning about medicine and working with children. Some fun facts about me are that I have two brothers, one is 1 year older than me and 1 is one year younger than me. I have two loving dogs, one is a mini schnauzer and the other is a pug. I enjoy being in nature and my two favorite artists are Khalid and Kendrick.</p>
